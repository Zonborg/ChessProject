# Chess Java Project

1.  Made the tests pass
2.  Needed to adjust one of the jUnit tests as well as it was invalid
3.  Some refactor work could be done.  Will do this tomorrow.
4.  What additional tests could be added to aid in code coverage and insure 
    expected behaviour.
4.  How board is currently coded is that it has a 7x7 chess board whereas a 
    standard chessboard is 8x8.  Is this intentional?  Look into this tomorrow.
5.  Look at converting this file to a proper readme rather than just being the 
    thoughts of a single developer.
